# MGLT in HOURS

This code fetches starships data from SWAPI.CO (Star Wars API), indexes to an Elastic Search Docker Container and shows a single web page, which upon, you can input an integer number representing MGLT (MegaLights) and in return, you receive a list of the ships and aside, the number of hours it would take to travel (if it where real, and made any sense at all..).

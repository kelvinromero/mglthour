# MGLT in HOURS

This code fetches starships data from SWAPI.CO (Star Wars API), indexes to an Elastic Search Docker Container and shows a single web page, which upon, you can input an integer number representing MGLT (MegaLights) and in return, you receive a list of the ships and aside, the number of hours it would take to travel (if it where real, and made any sense at all..).

## Dependencies
- Docker-compose version 1.17.1
Instructions: [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## How to setup
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose up
```
Then, just go to development server at http://0.0.0.0:8080/
